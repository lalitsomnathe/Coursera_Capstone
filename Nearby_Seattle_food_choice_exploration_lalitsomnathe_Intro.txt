Hi everyone,
I would like to take this opportunity for completing the capstone project with the case study of Washington. Mainly because of SEATTLE.

(1. Background)
Why SEATLLE ? :-
https://www.tripsavvy.com/biggest-seattle-area-employers-2965051
SEATTLE host top employers like Boein, Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart.

The Seattle metropolitan area has more than 3.5 million inhabitants, making it the 15th largest metro area in the country.. http://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/seattle-population/
Wheare as Wahington hosts the population of 7,530,552.

Seattle being mostly workplace the most of population resides in nearby divisions : Bellevue,Everett metro division and the Tacoma metro division.
Due to increasingly big job opporutnities the population of this area is increasing rapidly. 
This includes people from different countries Indian, chinese, korean including native americans.

This indicates that there is definite diversitry in food choices.

(2&3. Which problem i.e. target audience and how can be solved)
I feel, It would be really great to do anlysis how food choices are spread across seattle in these different divisions.
This analysis could be really helpful if someone is looking for opening a new restaurant nearby.
He/She could get clear picture where to open the restaturant of his/her category/cuisine like indian chinese etc.
Suppose there is much concentration of Indian restaurants in a area, we can infer that there are more indian public residing nearby.
OR 
Also if some newbie wants to know where can he/she get the good number of choices for particular category, this can be explored with above analysis.
